                        <p>Rock trips are all about going back to where it all began - the great outdoors. Equilibrium may be a closed space with plastic holds for climbing, but eventually, our desire is that more people step outside for an adventure and climb formations that have stood for a thousand years. Climbing indoors strengthens and teaches you movements that you can take into the outside world and elicit maximum fun from outdoor visits. There is learning in climbing both indoor and outdoor. The RockTrips ensure you are exposed to both worlds in equal measures.</p>

                        <p>Climbing teaches to use your being in entirety. You are not just using your wrists or your legs or your arms. You are using every bit of yourself, every minute. Your entire body is engaged and ready for the next move and the move after that. You take your mind off one part and you risk coming off the wall.</p>
                        <p>Your mind is working furiously, weighing the various possibilities. There's a hundred ways to get from one hold to another. But you need to find which way works best for you. One size does not fit all, when it comes to climbing. You are constantly readjusting, recalculating and moving forward. You are in every sense of the word, busy, while climbing. Most importantly, you learn to not categories your capabilities as physical and mental, you learn to recognize your self as one.</p>
